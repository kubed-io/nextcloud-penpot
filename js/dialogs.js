 * THE ONE CONFIRMATION EVERY ADMIN SURFACE IN THIS APP USES.
 *
 * Loaded before `mapping-settings.js` and `sync-settings.js` on their settings
 * sections, so a modal added to either is the same modal — same shape, same
 * button order, same destructive styling. It exists because the panel briefly
 * had two answers to "are you sure": a native dialog for deleting a mapping and
 * a card status line for the purge, which is the same question asked twice in
 * two voices.
 *
 * Vanilla, unbundled, and a `window` global on purpose: `js/` is served verbatim
 * with no build step, so the two page scripts cannot import from each other.

	/**
	 * Ask a destructive question, and act on the answer AT MOST ONCE.
	 *
	 * ## THE NATIVE DIALOG, AND WHY IT IS THE RIGHT ONE
	 *
	 * `OC.dialogs.confirmDestructive` is not the browser's alert box and not the
	 * old jQuery one either: in Nextcloud 34 it is built on the same `DialogBuilder`
	 * the Vue components use, so it inherits the instance's theming for free. Read
	 * out of the shipped `core-main.js`, not assumed. The option shape below —
	 * `YES_NO_BUTTONS`, an explicit destructive verb, `confirmClasses: 'error'` —
	 * is copied from the Files app's own delete confirmation.
	 *
	 * ## THE ONCE-ONLY LATCH IS NOT DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING. IT IS A CORE BUG.
	 *
	 * `confirmDestructive` finishes with:
	 *
	 *     .build().show().then(() => { callback.clicked || callback(false) })
	 *
	 * meaning "if no button was pressed, treat it as a no". But the button
	 * callbacks it built for `YES_NO_BUTTONS` come from `_getLegacyButtons`, which
	 * records the press as:
	 *
	 *     callback._clicked = true
	 *
	 * `clicked` is set on one path and `_clicked` on the other, so the guard never
	 * matches and EVERY answer is followed by a second, spurious `callback(false)`
	 * the moment the dialog closes.
	 *
	 * A cancel branch that merely returns hides it — which is why deleting a
	 * mapping looked fine for a week. A cancel branch that reports anything shows
	 * it: confirming the design purge flashed "Not saved — the folder still holds
	 * designs" over a mapping that was being created successfully. Found by hand,
	 * on a live instance.
	 *
	 * So the latch lives here rather than in each caller, and no modal in this app
	 * can be written wrong in the same way again.
	 *
	 * @param {object} opts
	 * @param {string} opts.title       dialog heading
	 * @param {string} opts.text        the body — say what is at stake, in numbers
	 * @param {string} opts.confirm     the destructive verb, not "Yes"
	 * @param {string} [opts.cancel]    defaults to "Cancel"
	 * @param {Function} opts.onConfirm
	 * @param {Function} [opts.onCancel]
