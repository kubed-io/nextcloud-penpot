# Notes, decisions and history for this feature: AGENTS.md#lifecycle

Feature: App install lifecycle
  As a Nextcloud admin
  I want the penpot_sync app to enable and disable cleanly
  So that installing or removing it never leaves the instance broken

  Scenario: Enabling the app
    When the admin enables the app
    Then the app should be enabled
    And the app is installed correctly
    And ".penpot" files are registered as their own file type
    # THE MIMETYPE IS AN END STATE OF ENABLING, not a feature of its own. It used
    # to head a file called "A mirrored Penpot file is a first-class file type",
    # which described the registration as though someone had gone and done it —
    # but nobody registers a mimetype; they install an app, and the registration
    # is what the install left behind. Its visible consequence (a mapped folder
    # that looks like designs) is view-design.feature's, and its removal is
    # uninstall.feature's.
    # notes: AGENTS.md#enabling-the-app

  Scenario: Disabling the app
    Given the app is enabled
    When the admin disables the app
    Then the app is not enabled
