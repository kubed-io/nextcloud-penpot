# Notes, decisions and history for this feature: AGENTS.md#lifecycle

Feature: App install lifecycle
  As a Nextcloud admin
  I want the penpot_sync app to enable and disable cleanly
  So that installing or removing it never leaves the instance broken

  Scenario: Enabling the app
    When the admin enables the app
    Then the app should be enabled
    And the app is installed correctly

  Scenario: Disabling the app
    Given the app is enabled
    When the admin disables the app
    Then the app is not enabled
